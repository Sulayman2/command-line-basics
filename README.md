# command-line-basics

I started by creating a directory called projects with the command line, mkdir
I switched to the directory created, projects with the command line, cd projects
I created a file inside the projects directory with the command line mkdir. The files created are week1, week2
I changed the directory, cd to the week1 file to create a file called hello.txt with the command line touch hello.txt
I reversed to the projects directory, copied the text in week1 to week2 using the command line, cp week1/hello.txt week2
I changed the directory to week2 with the command line, cd week2
I renamed the text copied to week2 to hello_copy.txt with the command line, mv hello.txt hello_copy.txt
I reversed to the project directory, changed the directory to week one and removed the hello.txt with the command line, rm hello.txt
